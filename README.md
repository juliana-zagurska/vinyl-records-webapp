# vinyl-records-webapp
Hi! 

In this project I created a simplified records search page.
User has an ability to :
* check available records
* search by desired parameters (Artist name, Genre, Decade, Country)
* add them to personal collection (records are also added to local storage of the browser)
* mark records as favourites
* mobile version is fully usable as well
